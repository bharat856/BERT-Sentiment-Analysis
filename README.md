# BERT-Sentiment-Analysis
<br>
Sentiment analysis using BERT NN.
<br>
FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text.
<br>
I have used this to analyse Yelp review.
<br>
Here the scores are generated based on feeding the model the comments that have been scrapped. The values range from 5 to 1, 1 being the most positive and vice versa.
